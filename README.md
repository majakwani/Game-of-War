A project created using concept of asynchronous javascript, promises specifically. 
It is a simple game with a deck of cards. 
A button named Draw Cards is presented in the game which when clicked draws 2 cards from the deck. 
Those 2 cards are rendered in the UI and our program checks whether user's card is higher or computer's card is higher. 
The process keeps repeating until there are no more cards remaining in the deck. 
A resultant message is displayed which renders the name of the winner along with scores.
